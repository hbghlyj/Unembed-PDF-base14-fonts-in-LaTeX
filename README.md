# Unembed PDF base14 fonts in LaTeX
## ü§îWhy
The PDF specification requires that a PDF viewer/printer/whatever must have the [base 14 fonts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format#Standard_Type_1_Fonts) embedded. Because of this, there is not need for an application to embed those fonts in a document.

## üåüBenefit
1. Reduce file size.
2. Make the text editable in PDF editors (Adobe Acrobat can recognize base14 fonts, so can edit most of texts without switching to a different font).

## ‚ö†Ô∏èDanger
[Symbol font](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/symbol) (`\sum` and `\prod` and greek letters) despite being one of base14 fonts, does **not** work in **MS Edge** and **Adobe Acrobat**.<br>
It works in [SumatraPDF](https://sumatrapdfreader.org/) and [Mozilla PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) and Firefox and Chrome.

## `pdffonts` output
As you can see from the `emb` column, PDF base14 fonts (including Times, Courier, Symbol) are not embedded.

# How to compile
1. load the project into Overleaf
2. select `latex` engine
3. compile
## Note
Latexmk is used by Overleaf to control the compilation of your source LaTeX document into the final typeset PDF file. By using a customized configuration file called Latexmk you can override the default compilation commands to allow Overleaf to compile your document in a special way: In this project, first `latex` produces a `dvi` file, then `dvipdfmx` runs with the file `fontmap` as font map.

# File size comparison

| | size |
|--|--|
| original | 102 KB|
| processed | 13.4 KB|

Differences: The original PDF is compiled by `pdflatex` engine (with default font map) and without `mathastext` package.
